Advantages of a Desktop Application

Better Performance

Direct access to system resources
No HTTP overhead or browser rendering limitations
Faster image loading and display


Richer User Experience

Native UI components and interactions
More responsive interface
Better integration with the operating system


Offline Functionality

Works completely offline with no web server needed
Simpler deployment for end users


Enhanced Features

Direct filesystem integration for importing/exporting data
Ability to use system dialogs for file selection
Potentially faster image processing and caching



Potential Challenges

Cross-Platform Compatibility

Ensuring consistent look and behavior across operating systems
May need to handle platform-specific quirks


Distribution and Updates

Need to build separate executables for different platforms
Updates require users to download and install new versions
May need an auto-update system


Deployment Size

Executable size will be larger as it includes Python and all dependencies
May require an installer for proper setup



Summary
Converting this web application to a desktop program would involve significant restructuring, but would result in a more integrated, responsive application with better performance characteristics. The most fundamental change would be moving from the callback-based paradigm of Dash to the event-driven programming model of desktop GUI frameworks.
The card selection mechanism in particular would become much simpler and more direct, as you'd handle the selection event directly in your application code rather than through web callbacks and JavaScript bridges.
