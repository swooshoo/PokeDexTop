## Advantages of a Desktop Application

Better Performance: Direct access to system resources. No HTTP overhead or browser rendering limitations. Faster image loading and display

Richer User Experience: Native UI components and interactions. More responsive interface. Better integration with the operating system

Offline Functionality: Works completely offline with no web server needed. Simpler deployment for end users

Enhanced Features: Direct filesystem integration for importing/exporting data. Ability to use system dialogs for file selection. Potentially faster image processing and caching

## Potential New Challenges

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensuring consistent look and behavior across operating systems. May need to handle platform-specific quirks

Distribution and Updates: Need to build separate executables for different platforms. Updates require users to download and install new versions. May need an auto-update system

Deployment Size: Executable size will be larger as it includes Python and all dependencies
May require an installer for proper setup
